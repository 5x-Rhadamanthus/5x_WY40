#  WY40

The WY40 is a 40% HHKB cosmetically inspired by the Wyse PCE series of terminal keyboards. The board utilizes a layout very similar to the JD45, which should allow for a decent amount of keycap compatibility. The keyboard uses a novel mounting mechanism in which a rubber o-ring is wrapped around the mounting tabs of the keyboard and used as alignment tabs and as a vibration reducing gasket.
